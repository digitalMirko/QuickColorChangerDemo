App created in Android Studio 3.2.1 and tested on a Google Nexus 5X API 28 Android 9 Emulator

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Quick Color Changer' demo app icon and they are taken right into the demo. 
They are greeted with a top color bar with the App's name 'Quick Color Changer Demo' and a grey background. 
Followed by a series of radio buttons in a vertical group setting. Each one with a different color name.
As the user clicks a radio button the background changes color and the color selected is shown in the radio button.
Along with a textView over the group calling out the color selected.

This app demonstrates how quickly you can change the layout background by just selecting a radio button.
